In this personal/academic github the following projects are displyed:

- Projeto-2-CDados: investigation on how social variables may impact the Math grades on the National High School Exam (ENEM). Starting with database containing 136 columns and 5,000,000 rows, with each row representing a student and the columns containing various social variables. To streamline our analysis, we reduced the dataset to 11 columns and a random sample of 120,000 rows. Linear regression and Ramdom Forest Regression were used to model and predict the results.
