# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Ana!

In this personal/academic github the following projects are displayed:

- EP_Craps: implementation of the craps game, in which players bet on the outcomes of the roll of a pair of dice.
- introduction_ai: introductory course on artificial inteligence. We explored concepts such as autonomous agent, search strategies, heuristics, and reinforcement learning.
- Projeto-2-CDados: investigation on how social variables may impact the Math grades on the National High School Exam (ENEM). Starting with database containing 136 columns and 5,000,000 rows, with each row representing a student and the columns containing various social variables. To streamline our analysis, we reduced the dataset to 11 columns and a random sample of 120,000 rows. Linear regression and Ramdom Forest Regression were used to model and predict the results.

For confidentiality reasons, I am unable to share the work I completed during my 10-month internship in Automation at BTG Pactual. However, my primary task was to develop solutions that automated routines for the bank's internal areas. One of my solutions for the insurance team involved creating a Python lambda function implemented in AWS that consumed events from an SQS queue. These events corresponded to actions taken in an app and triggered changes in the Jira tracking platform. I also participated in another project, which involved creating a screen using Angular for the legal team to register and search documents.
